# Little Chefs

Little Chefs is a blind box company dedicated to inspire young culinary artists. Each box contains a miniature chef figure along with a recipe card and ingredients to build and to master culinary arts. 

There are many series to collect each along with many recipes and many different chefs. This takes young culinary artists on a delicius journey through different cuisines encouraging them to explore new ingredients and cooking techniques. 

Our mission is to make cooking fun and accesible showing everyone they can be a Little Chefs, by combining the excitment of blind boxes with the joy of cooking. We hope to spark a life long passion for cooking and creativity in children everywhere.
